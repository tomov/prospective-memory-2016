1) correlation matrix - why correlation between Context & other Context is bad in Focal vs. nonfocal

b/c of the "jolt" that the PM target produces in WM -- for focal, the "jolt" is bigger (not just for the task units); for nonfocal, it's smaller ; see nonfocal-why-context-corr-is-bad.fig and focal-why-context-corr-is-bad.fig

2) correlation increases if there's a lot more PM trials, e.g. every 5. Also for 100 trials total. Low emphasis (focal vs. nonfocal).
